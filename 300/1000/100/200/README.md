# 200 - Include via CDN

The quickest way to get started working with Flowbite is to simply include the CSS and JavaScript into your project via a CDN service such as UNPKG or CDNJS (content delivery networks).

Require the following minified stylesheet inside the ```head``` tag:

```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.5.2/dist/flowbite.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

And include the following javascript file before the end of the ```body``` tag:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.5.2/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```
