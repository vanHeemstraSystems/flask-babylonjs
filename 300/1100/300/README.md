# 300 - Step 02 - Setting up an example Database and Model

In this step, you’ll set up your Flask application and a Flask-SQLAlchemy database with a model representing a users table where you’ll store your app’s users.

In your ```flask_app/app``` directory, open a file called ```__init__.py```. This will hold your Flask application’s app core code:


```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from flask import Flask
from config import Config
from app.extensions import db, bcrypt, login_manager, socketio
...
def create_app(config_class=Config):
    app = Flask(__name__, static_url_path='/static')
    app.config.from_object(config_class)

    # Initialize Flask extensions here
    db.init_app(app)

    from app.routes.user_routes import user_bp
    app.register_blueprint(user_bp, url_prefix='/users')

    return app
```
flask_app/app/__init__.py


You import the ```Flask``` class and ```SQLAlchemy``` from the ```flask``` and ```flask_sqlalchemy``` modules (from ```app.extensions```) here. Then you create a Flask app instance called ```app```.

Next, you set the SQLite database URI in the app configuration (here ```flask_app/config.py```); this specifies the database file name as ```app.db```. This database file will be created in a new folder inside called ````instance````, which will be generated by Flask in the ```flask_app``` main directory.

In ```flask_app/app/extensions.py``` with ```db = SQLAlchemy()```, you create an SQLAlchemy instance, ```db```. 

By passing the Flask ```app``` as an argument, you initiate the ```db``` in ```flask_app/app/__init__.py``` with ```db.init_app(app)```.
